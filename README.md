- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned about the scope attribute, if we have a vertical header cells table (like in this project) with the scope attribute we can define the scope of the header cells (where the header cell is pointing to) to make the table more accessible. 

```html
<th
  scope="row"
  class="nutrition-table-head font-normal neutral-color-wenge-brown"
>
  Calories
</th>
```

- How can we create custom bullet points, we can select them saparately and style them as we like.

```css
.prep-time-list-item::before,
.ingredients-list-item::before {
  content: "â€¢";
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  font-size: 1.3rem;
  color: var(--primary-dark-raspberry);
  line-height: 1;
}
```

- learned about counter-reset and counter-increment properties, with this properties we can create custom
number list (example:- for ol) and we can style them as we like.

```css
.instructions-list {
  display: grid;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  counter-reset: my-counter;
  margin-block-end: 1.9rem;
}

.instructions-list-item::before {
  counter-increment: my-counter;
  content: counter(my-counter) ". ";
  position: absolute;
  left: 0.5rem;
  top: 0;
  font-family: var(--font-family-outfit);
  font-weight: 700;
  color: var(--primary-nutmeg);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue focusing on how can i use semantic tags in meaningfull way and about accessiblility how can i make my website more accessible there is so much to learn about semantic markup and accessiblility.
